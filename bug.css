The following CSS code snippet has a common error that can lead to unexpected behavior or styling issues.  The error is related to incorrect usage of the `:hover` pseudo-class along with other styles that are not correctly prioritized or specified.

```css
a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
a:visited {
  color: purple;
}
```

The problem arises when the `a:visited` style overrides or interacts unexpectedly with `a:hover`. The browser's order of style application might cause the hover state to not appear as expected, or the visited link color might be incorrectly shown while hovering.
